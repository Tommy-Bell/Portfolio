# Command Items
## Description
Similarly to Saved Items, this allowed for the creation (in config) of items to be given to the player, except in this case, the items upon being right clicked executed a command (such as make a firework effect) and take the item away from them. This was so that players could be given physical "rewards" as opposed to them being redeemed instantly.
