# Parties
## Description
This mod allowed admins to give a shiny/regular random pokemon to every player on the server. It also allowed for timed shiny parties, which meant that any player that joined in a set time would get a random shiny. Donator shiny parties allowed the player to tip currency to a donator that initiated a shiny party upon donating to the server.
