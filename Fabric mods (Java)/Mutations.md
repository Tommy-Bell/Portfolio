# Mutations
## Description
This allowed a player to "sacrifice" pokemon, recieving a special currency. They can then upgrade pokemon of that same species using the special currency of that species, making them have special textures, be shiny, etc. This was quite hard as I needed to dynamically create a currency per species to track sacrifices per player.
