# Crafting
## Description
This allowed for custom crafting recipes to be generated. This was pretty hard as config data had to be formatted in the correct json format, fed into a mixin and converted into a crafting recipe to work. Converting it into the correct format was quite challenging, as I wanted to make the config as simple as possible.
