# Games Mod
## Description
This is a mod I made for a Minecraft Cobblemon (fabric) server. I had to learn lots of skills in the creation of this project. The games stored inside the single .jar file were Bingo, Hunts and Community Events, each of which were easily created and modifiable through json config files.
