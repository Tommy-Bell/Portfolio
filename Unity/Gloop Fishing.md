## Description

Gloop fishing is a calm fishing game, where you play as a slime called Gloop, trying to catch as many fish as you can. You can progress by buying better equipment with gloopcoins, earnt by catching fish.  The game has no definitive end, but has completionist aspects such as the fish log; the player trying to catch every fish (and getting them logged in the log).

The game got me to be a finalist in the 2023 BAFTA YGD competition, which can be viewed [here](https://ygd.bafta.org/winners-nominees/2023)
