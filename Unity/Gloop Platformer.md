## Description
Gloop platformer is a platformer game as my first Unity game. I drew everything apart from the cheese, bosses, mini-anubis', terrain and background. None of the music was created by me, and all the credits are on the download site. <br />
<br />
This was my first attempt at an actual game; meaning most art was from free online assets. In my second game, Gloop Fishing, I drew everything to make the game feel more personalized. Most code in Gloop Platformer was original (with all being mine in Gloop Fishing).
