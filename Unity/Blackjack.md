# Blackjack
## Description
This was a game I made as a compulsory project. The task was to make a game of blackjack, so I created this goofy 3D game. Its my first 3D Unity game, and also my first original game thats playable online. I learnt lots about calling methods from Unity animation clips making this project, which I'll put towards my future projects.
